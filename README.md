# crimaptools

R Library for preparing input files, running, and parsing output for the programme Cri-MAP. Still in progress - use at your own risk. Currently optimised for biallelic data only but potential to be used with microsatellites. A tutorial is provided [here](https://github.com/susjoh/crimaptools/raw/master/crimaptools_tutorial.pdf). If you would like help using `crimaptools`, or would like to help develop it further, please email Susan.Johnston@ed.ac.uk with any queries.
